# Revamp Task Index

This branch implements the UI/UX revamp. See `REVAMP_ROADMAP.md` for full details. Implementation tasks are tracked in file-specific checklists:

- [ ] TODO_nav.md - Adaptive Navigation & Responsive Menu Tasks
- [x] TODO_theme.md - Dark/Light Mode Toggle Tasks
- [ ] TODO_i18n.md - Internationalization (Multilingual) Tasks
- [ ] TODO_layout.md - Structured Sections & Responsive Design Tasks
- [ ] TODO_tooltips.md - Tippy.js Tooltip Tasks

Follow the tasks in the respective files to track progress. Once completed, mark the tasks in the corresponding file.
- [x] Remove duplicate Docker commands in `README.md`.
- [x] Add fixture to run `freezer.freeze()` automatically when tests need the build.
